<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Welcome! You have arrived at an online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that is owned and/or operated by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (collectively, "<strong>HMH</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>our</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>"). This "<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>" governs your use of any online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that posts a link to this Privacy Policy (each a "<strong>Site</strong>") (including, without limitation, both mobile and online versions of the Site). It also applies to your use of interactive features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and/or other services that: (i) we own and control and make available through a Site; or (ii) that posts a link to the Privacy Policy (collectively with each Site, the "<strong>Service</strong>"). It applies regardless of how you access or use the Service, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise. It does not apply to data we receive from third parties except to the extent we combine such data with Personal Information (defined below) that we have ourselves collected under this Privacy Policy. Our statements under this Privacy Policy only apply to our privacy practices on the Service, and do not apply to any third parties that may independently interact with our Service.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to our data collection activities offline or otherwise outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below). To the extent we provide you notice on our Service of different or additional privacy policies or practices (e.g., at the point of our collection), those additional terms shall govern such data collection and use. Due to the diverse nature of our businesses, companies within the Houghton Mifflin family of companies may have different privacy policies. In such cases, the privacy policy of the particular company or business unit will be posted, and will supersede the terms of this Privacy Policy in the event of a conflict.</p>
<p>In addition, please review the Service's&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hmhco.com/common/terms-conditions">Terms of Use</a>, which govern your use of the Service. By using our Service, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use and our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below.</p>

<p>We may use various methods and technologies to collect or store Usage Information ("Tracking Technologies"). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations on your Device. A few of the&nbsp;<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>&nbsp;include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and methods later developed):</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em>. A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Service. A Flash cookie (or locally shared object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies go to Adobe's web site&nbsp;www.adobe.com.&nbsp;<em>Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Service may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Service your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</em></p>
<p><em>Web Beacons</em>. Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") may be included in our Service's pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</p>
<p><em>Embedded Scripts</em>. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third-party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
<p><em>ETag, or entity tag</em>. A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>

<p>The Service may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Service and your account on a third-party web site or application. The use of this functionality may involve the third-party operator providing certain information, including Personal Information, to us. For example, when you register with the Service, you may have an option to use your Facebook, Google or other account information provided by a third-party site or application to facilitate the registration and log-in or transaction process on the Service, or otherwise link accounts. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality to access our Service, the third-party site or application may send Personal Information about you to the Service. If so, we will then treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy, since we are collecting it as a result of your accessing of and interaction on our Service. In addition, we may provide third-party sites' interfaces or links on the Service to facilitate your sending a communication from the Service. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties' practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. We may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.

Profile information is used by us primarily to be presented back to and edited by you when you access the Service and to be presented to others permitted to view that information on the Service. In some cases (e.g., posting to your page), other users of the Service may be able to supplement your profile.

Further, while we and third party sites that display our ads may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit&nbsp;http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp, which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the "opt-out" procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer will be allowed under their own rules to deliver Behavioral Ads to you, which will affect this and other sites, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Therefore, if you use multiple Devices or multiple browsers on a single Device, you need to opt-out for each browser that you use on your Device. Additionally, if you delete your cookies, change browsers, or use a different Device, you will need to opt-out again. Additional information is available on the NAI's web site accessible by the above link. Where we serve third-party Behavioral Ads on the Service we participate in the notice and opt-out program run by the Digital Advertising Alliance ("<strong>DAA</strong>"), and you can learn more about it and the opt-out choices it offers at&nbsp;http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Where we serve our own Behavioral Ads on third party sites, we request that they comply with the DAA program so that you have the same notice and opt-out choice. Please note that similar limitations as described regarding NAI opt-out may apply to the DAA opt-out. In the event that we allow third parties to display advertisements that are directly targeted at users in the EU, please visit&nbsp;http://www.youronlinechoices.com&nbsp;to learn more about your options. Similar limitations may apply to these opt-out methods. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs.</p>

</ol>
<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information you have provided through the Service's registration forms or otherwise, and you may provide registration updates and changes, and otherwise request access to your information, by contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@hmhco.com">privacy@hmhco.com</a>. European residents should also see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hmhco.com/common/privacy-policy#AL27">Section 8</a>&nbsp;below. If so, we will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then active databases as soon as reasonably practicable. With respect to our mobile and other applications (i.e., when we are the application publisher), you can prospectively stop all collection of information by the application by uninstalling the application. You may use the standard uninstall process as may be available as part of your applicable Device or potentially via the appropriate application or app marketplace. Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed. When you edit your Personal Information or change your preferences on the Service, information that you remove may persist internally for our administrative purposes. You may cancel or modify our e-mail marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional e-mails or in some cases by logging into your account and changing your communication preferences. This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and if your opt-out is limited to certain types of e-mails the opt-out will be so limited. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your Account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements and, except as prescribed by applicable law, these transactional Account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.

<p>Our Service is operated in the United States and is primarily intended for users located in the United States, and some parts of our Service may be intended also for users located in Canada and EEA. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Service or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>") or Switzerland, you may ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. Further, you can prevent such processing by indicating who you are and any contact information you have previously provided to us, asking us to cease processing your personal data and indicating your jurisdiction of residence, by contacting us in the following ways: By Postal Mail: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, Attn: Privacy Policy Inquiries, 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116; By E-mail: privacy@hmhco.com.</p>

</ol>
<p>We understand the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive world. We do not use the Service to knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of thirteen (13) without verified parental consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. Furthermore, most of the portions of our Service that are directed to children 12 years and under are designed so that we do not collect Personal Information at all. In the event any of the Services designed for children 12 years and under, or designed for both such children and older users, do have aspects where we may collect Personal information we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("<strong>COPPA</strong>"), including its verified parental consent requirements. In addition, we will post a separate Children's Privacy Policy on such portions of the Services that explains further what types of Personal information may be collected, under what circumstances, for what purposes and what options parents have to approve or limit such collection.</p>
<p>In the event that we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from any child absent the parental consent required by COPPA, or as otherwise permitted by COPPA, we will dispose of that information in accordance with applicable law. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child under the age of 13 has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@hmhco.com">here</a>&nbsp;and we will take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is deleted from our files.</p>

Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of the Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use.

<p>Effective Date: March 8, 2013.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. IT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction and Overview</strong></p>
<p>Welcome!  You have arrived at an online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that is owned and/or operated by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company (collectively, "HMH," "we," "our" or "us").  These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your use of any online service location (e.g., web site or mobile app) that posts a link to these Terms ("Site") (including both mobile and online versions), and also applies to all features, widgets, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads and/or other services that are owned and controlled by us and that are available through or interact with a Site, and/or that post or link to these Terms (collectively, the "Service(s)"), regardless of how you access or use it, whether via computer, mobile device or otherwise.  By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept the Service's <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/~/link.aspx?_id=BF7ABD360B884177BF18CF6B5C8114C5&amp;_z=z">Privacy Policy</a>  and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with its <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/~/link.aspx?_id=BF7ABD360B884177BF18CF6B5C8114C5&amp;_z=z">Privacy Policy</a>.  By using the Service, you further agree that HMH may change, alter, or modify the settings or configurations on your Device (defined below) in order to allow for or optimize your use of the Service.  Consequently, by interacting with and/or using the Service, you signify your assent and agreement to these Terms.  If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Service.<br>
It is important that you read these entire Terms; but to help facilitate your review, here are some of the more significant terms we want to bring to your initial attention that are further detailed below.  Capitalized terms have the meanings given to them where defined in these Terms. </p>
<ul>
    <li>Each time you use the Service, the Terms and any Additional Terms (defined below) then posted apply so you should check back each time you return for any updates.  </li>
    <li><a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL1">Click here</a> for a summary of each section of these Terms.  You may click on the topic for full details.</li>
    <li>You may only use the Content (defined below) on the Service in connection with your permitted activities on the Service and not in an offline environment or in connection with another site or service. (<a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL2">Section 1 </a> and <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL7">Section 3</a> You automatically grant us a license to content you submit or post.  (<a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL4">Section 2  </a>)</li>
    <li>Individual licenses are not transferrable. (<a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL3">Section 1.C</a>)</li>
    <li>Except as set forth in the <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/~/link.aspx?_id=BF7ABD360B884177BF18CF6B5C8114C5&amp;_z=z">Privacy Policy</a>  that applies to the Service, you and HMH do not have a confidential, fiduciary, or any other special relationship by virtue of your use of the Service or your communications to us through or related to the Service. (<a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL4">Section 2  </a>) </li>
    <li>You consent to our <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/~/link.aspx?_id=BF7ABD360B884177BF18CF6B5C8114C5&amp;_z=z">Privacy Policy</a> and our practices detailed in it, including targeted advertising.</li>
    <li>As permitted by law, many types of disputes that may arise in connection with your access to and use of the Service may be subject to mandatory arbitration â€“ which includes your waiver of a right to a jury trial. (<a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL17">Section 12</a> )</li>
    <li>We are providing the Service to you on an "as-is" basis, without any warranty of any kind, and our liability to you in connection with your use of the Service is very limited.  Many other limitations and disclaimers relate to your use of the Service. (<a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL20">Section 14</a> and <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL21">Section 15</a> )</li>

<p><strong>If You Want to Use The Service,</strong></p>
<p>then carefully read these Terms (including all links to details), as they constitute a written agreement between you and us and they affect your legal rights and obligations.  The summaries of provisions and section headings are provided for convenience only and shall not limit the full Terms.  If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence, you may use the Service only with involvement of a parent or guardian who agrees to these Terms and to be responsible for your use. </p>
<p>Each time you access and/or use the Service (other than to simply read these Terms), you agree to be bound by and comply with the Terms and any Additional Terms (defined below) then posted.  Therefore, <strong><em>do not use the Service if you do not agree</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The business realities associated with operating the Service are such that, without the limitations that are set forth in these Terms â€“ such as your grants and waivers of rights, the limitations on our liability, your indemnity of us, and our arbitration of  certain disputes â€“ we would not make the Service available to you.</p>
<p>By accessing and/or using any of the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.  In some instances, both these Terms and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of use, service or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Service or to a service or product offered via the Service (in each such instance, and collectively, "<strong>Additional Terms</strong>").  To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.  Please also review the terms of the Service's <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/~/link.aspx?_id=BF7ABD360B884177BF18CF6B5C8114C5&amp;_z=z">Privacy Policy</a> which you accept by using the Service.</p>

Each time you submit any User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User-Generated Content you submit, and that, as to that User-Generated Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User-Generated Content, or you have a lawful right to submit the User-Generated Content and grant HMH the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms and any Additional Terms, all without any HMH obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of HMH; (b) the User-Generated Content is accurate; (c) the User-Generated Content does not and, as to HMH's permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d) the User-Generated Content will not violate these Terms (including the <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL6">Rules</a>) or any Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person. </li>
            <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enforcement</span></strong>.

        <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community Usage Rules.</span></strong>  As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules ("Rules") are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Service's online communities ("Communities").
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>
            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nature of Rules</span></strong>.  Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your User-Generated Content</strong>.  All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any Additional Terms.  Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.  Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.  If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to HMH.  (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to HMH as your User-Generated Content, then you must obtain your friend's and the photographer's permission to do so.)</li>
                <li><strong>Speaking of Photos:  No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family</strong>.  If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know â€“ and only if you have their express permission to submit it.</li>
                <li><strong>Act Appropriately</strong>.  All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. Be respectful of others' opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.  If you think your User-Generated Content might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn't belong on the Service.  Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.

        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Availability of Service and Content</span></strong>.  HMH may immediately suspend or terminate the availability of the Service and Content (and any elements and features of them), in whole or in part, for any reason, in HMH's sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability.  </li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Reservation of All Rights Not Granted as to Content and Service</span></strong>.

In order to access or use some (or potentially all) of the features on the Service, you may be given the opportunity to open, revise and close user accounts ("<strong>Accounts</strong>"), subject to certain rules.  The Service's practices governing any resulting collection, use, disclosure and management of your personal information are disclosed in its <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/~/link.aspx?_id=BF7ABD360B884177BF18CF6B5C8114C5&amp;_z=z">Privacy Policy</a>.

        <br>
        Portions of the Service may permit access through multi-user Accounts.  If so, and if you use the Service under a multi-user Account, your use may be subject to Additional Terms, and your Service activities and related information may be made available to the master Account holder and/or license manager.  See <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL9">Section 4.C</a> for more information.<br>
        <br>
        If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or username, then you will select your own password at the time of registration (or we may send you an e-mail notification with a randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You will not use a username (or e-mail address) that is already being used by someone else, may impersonate another person, belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or other right of any person or entity, or is offensive.  We may reject the use of any password, username, or e-mail address for any other reason in our sole discretion; (ii) You will provide true, accurate, current, and complete registration information about yourself in connection with the registration process and, as permitted, to maintain and update it, including on your Profile Page (if applicable), continuously and promptly to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (iii) You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, password, and username â€“ whether or not you authorized the activity; (iv) You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for restricting access to your Device so that others may not access any password protected portion of the Service using your name, username, or password; (v) You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your Account, password, or username, or any other breach of security; and (vi) You will not sell, transfer, or assign your Account or any Account rights.
        <br>
        <br>
        We will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and under any legal theory) to you or any third party arising from your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of the foregoing obligations.
        <br>
        <br>
        If any information that you provide, or if we have reasonable grounds to suspect that any information that you provide, is false, inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or violates these Terms, any Additional Terms, or any applicable law, then we may suspend or terminate your Account.  We also reserve the more general and broad right to terminate your account or suspend or otherwise deny you access to it or its benefits â€“ all in our sole discretion, for any reason, and without advance notice or liability.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Profiles</span></strong>.  We may offer you the opportunity to create a unique personal profile (the "<strong>Profile Page</strong>"), which will allow you to find and communicate with other users of the Service.  Your Profile Page may not include any form of prohibited User-Generated Content, as outlined in <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL5">Section 2.A</a> above and in our <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL6">Rules</a>. Without limiting the foregoing, Profile Pages may not include content that you are attempting to sell through the Service, and cannot be used to conduct commercial activities, including, but not limited to, transactions, advertising, fundraising, contests or other promotions absent our prior written consent.  We may offer you the ability to set preferences relating to your Account, Profile Page and/or Service activities, but such settings may not become effective immediately or be error free, and options may change from time-to-time.  We assume no responsibility or liability for users' profile material.<br>
        <br>
        Profile Pages may only be set up by an authorized representative of the individual that is the subject of the Profile Page.  We do not review Profile Pages to determine if they were created by an appropriate party, and we are not responsible for any unauthorized Profile Pages that may appear on the Service.  If there is any dispute as to whether a Profile Page has been created or is being maintained by an authorized representative of the individual who is the subject of that Profile Page, then we shall have the sole right, but are not obligated, to resolve such dispute as we determine is appropriate in our sole discretion.  Such resolution may include, without limitation, deleting or disabling access to Profile Pages, or any portion thereof, at any time without notice.</li>
        <li><a name="AL9"> </a><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi-User Accounts</span></strong>.  Portions of the Service may permit access through a multi-user Account.  Such access would enable the purchaser to obtain a multi-user license, whereupon your Service Account would be given special access and permission rights to allow a certain number of specific, individual users to access and use the Service under your master Account.  Such individual users will still be required to register and accept these Terms, but their license and Account will be contingent upon your continued designation of such individual as one of your multi-user Account users.  A multi-user Account may require the designation of a license manager.  The license manager is the only individual permitted to invite others to access the Service under that multi-user Account.  If you access the Service through a multi-user Account, your use may be subject to Additional Terms, and your Service activities and related information may be made available to other Account users, the master Account holder and/or the license manager.</li>

    <strong>Procedure For Alleging Copyright Infringement </strong><br>
    <br>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
        <li>
        <strong>DMCA Notice.  </strong>HMH will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), as set forth below.  If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner's) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li>a legend or subject line that says: "DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice"; </li>
            <li>a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works; </li>
            <li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Service on which the material appears);</li>
            <li>your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address; </li>
            <li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; </li>
            <li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and</li>
            <li>your electronic or physical signature. </li>
        </ol>
        HMH will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail, e-mail, or facsimile at the addresses below:
        <p>By Mail:	Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachusetts  02116; Attn: DMCA Agent/Legal<br>
        <br>
        By E-Mail:	<a href="mailto:copyright@hmhco.com">copyright@hmhco.com</a><br>
        <br>
        By Facsimile:	(617) 351-1125</p>
        <p>It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.  HMH may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and HMH may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA. </p>
        <p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.</p>
        <p>We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.  That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.</p>
        <p>Without limiting HMH's other rights, HMH may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer's access to the Service and any other web site owned or operated by HMH.  See <a href="http://hmhco-v1.dev.techspa.com/layouts/sites/hmh/sublayouts/subscribe/FooterSubscribe.aspx?email=hh@g.com#AL8">Section 4 </a> above.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Counter-Notification. </strong>If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to HMH is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.  Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:
        <ol>
            <li>a legend or subject line that says:  "DMCA Counter-Notification";</li>
            <li>a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the URL of the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);</li>
            <li>a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;</li>
            <li>your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your Account;</li>
            <li>a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and</li>
            <li>your electronic or physical signature.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed of disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.</p>
    <p>If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.  However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.  You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.</p>

    <strong>Procedure For Alleging Infringement of Other Intellectual Property</strong><br>
    <br>
    <p>If you own intellectual property other than copyrights and believe that your intellectual property has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice to the addresses set forth above that includes all of the following:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
        <li>a legend or subject line that says:  "Intellectual Property Infringement Notice";</li>
        <li>a description of the intellectual property that you claim has been infringed; </li>
        <li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Service on which the material appears); </li>
        <li>your full name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address; </li>
        <li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner of the intellectual property, its agent, or the law; </li>
        <li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the owner of the intellectual property at issue (or, if you are not the owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that is allegedly infringed); and</li>
        <li>your electronic or physical signature. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We will act on such notices in our sole discretion.  Any user of the Service that fails to respond satisfactorily to HMH with regard to any such notice is subject to suspension or termination.  We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing material.  </p>

    <strong>Terms Applicable to Purchases on the Service</strong><br>
    <br>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Generally</span></strong>.  We may make products and/or services available for purchase on our Service, subject to applicable Additional Terms.  To purchase any products and/or services on our Service, you must be at least the applicable age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence.  </li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Methods of Payment, Credit Card Terms and Taxes</span></strong>.  All payments must be made by Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or American Express or any additional form of payment method we may from time-to-time specify.  Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card, and you must refer to that agreement and not these Terms to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.  You hereby represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary legal authorization to do so.  You agree to pay all fees and charges incurred in connection with your purchases (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred.  Unless you notify HMH of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your credit card statement, you agree that they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable law.  If HMH does not receive payment from your credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by HMH or its agents.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Order Acceptance Policy</span></strong>.  Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell.  Subject to applicable law, HMH reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason.  HMH further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item.  Your order will be deemed accepted by HMH upon our delivery of products or services that you have ordered.  We may require additional verifications or information before accepting any order.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that, if we cancel all or a portion of your order or if we provide you less than the quantity you ordered, your sole and exclusive remedy is either that: (a) we will issue a credit in the amount charged for the cancelled portion or the quantity not provided (if you have already been charged for the order); or (b) we will not charge you for the cancelled portion of the order or the quantity not provided.  Do not assume that a cancellation or change of an order you have placed with HMH has been effected until you receive a confirmation from HMH via e-mail or the Service.  As stated above, you will be responsible for, and your credit card or third-party payment account may be charged for, the payment of all fees associated with orders already processed or shipped before your cancellation/change request or a request to terminate your Account was received.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Responsibility to Sell Mispriced Products or Services</span></strong>.  We do our best to describe every product or service offered on this Service as accurately as possible.  However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Service is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free.  In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications of any item, product or service, HMH shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion.  If we charged your credit card prior to cancellation, we will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.  Additional terms may apply.  If a product you purchased from HMH is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.</li>

    <strong>Dispute Resolution</strong><br>
    <br>
    <p>Certain portions of this Section 12 are deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.  You and HMH agree that we intend that this Section 12 satisfies the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  Where arbitration is not permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, or where the parties have not otherwise agreed to arbitration in accordance with applicable laws, the provisions of Section 13 shall apply to all relevant disputes between you and us.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First â€“ Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes</span></strong>.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, if any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Service, the Content, your User-Generated Content,  these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, "<strong>Dispute</strong>"), or to any of HMH's actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an "<strong>Excluded Dispute</strong>", which includes those actions set forth in Section 12.D), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it.  Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us.  But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 12.A.  Your notice to us must be sent to: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116, Attn: General Counsel.  For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, HMH and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or HMH to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and HMH, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable. </li>
        <li>
        <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution.</span></strong>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li><strong>Arbitration</strong>.    If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 12.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 12.B.  If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 12.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and HMH consent, in a writing signed by you and an Officer or legal representative of HMH, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration.  In such a case (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a "Dispute" for the remainder of this Section 12.B.  <br>
            <br>
            Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").  If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes.  If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if HMH elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules.  The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.  If you and HMH do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 12.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 12.B will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.<br>
            <br>
            If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a "demand for arbitration," then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. ("JAMS") using JAMS' streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of HMH consent to in writing.  The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.  You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:<br>
            <br>
            AAA: 800.778.7879 JAMS: 949.224.1810<br>
            http://www.adr.org/ http://www.jamsadr.com/</li>
            <li><strong>Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong>.  In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys' fees).  However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED.  All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing.  If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the "metropolitan statistical area" (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration.  You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator's fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require HMH to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 12 to be enforceable, then HMH will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.  Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules.  The arbitrator's decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based.  Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.  </li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limited Time to File Claims</span></strong>.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT A EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.  </li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Injunctive Relief</span></strong>.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing provisions of this Section 12 will not apply to any legal action taken by HMH to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or HMH's intellectual property rights (including such HMH may claim that may be in dispute), HMH's operations, and/or HMH's products or services.  </li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement</span></strong>.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 12.G.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No Class Action Matters</span></strong>.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.  But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 12.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 12.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 12.G.  </li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Federal and State Courts in Suffolk County</span></strong>.  Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 12.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts.  Accordingly, you and HMH consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</li>

        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jurisdiction</span></strong>. The parties agree that the state or federal courts in Suffolk County, Massachusetts shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Section 13 Dispute, unless otherwise required by applicable laws of your jurisdiction of residence.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Governing Law</span></strong>.  To the maximum extent permitted by the mandatory laws in your country of residence, these Terms and any Section 13 Dispute arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes), will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Massachusetts, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.</li>
        <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limited Time to File Claims</span></strong>.  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A SECTION 13 DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE SECTION 13 DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED. </li>

ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Therefore, you should review the posted terms of service and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission).  The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to such prior use and any specific term to which we previously committed to apply those Terms (if applicable) (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only), unless mutually agreed.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You should frequently check the home page, your message account and the e-mail you associated with your Account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice.  You can reject any new, revised or additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Service and related services.

                    <h1>Kâ€“12 Standard Terms and Conditions</h1>
<ol>
<li>CONTRACT.â€ƒThe ordering or acceptance of any Products (defined in section 24 below) purchased from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) or  its applicable subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively, "HMH") by any purchaser (each a "Purchaser") shall constitute an agreement to these standard terms and conditions set forth herein (the "Terms").  These Terms, together with the terms and conditions published by HMH in the applicable HMH catalog, the HMH Cost Proposal, the HMH Quotation and order form (if applicable to Purchaser's purchase) collectively constitute the sole agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof, except for any agreements, amendments, or waivers agreed to in writing by both HMH and Purchaser.  Any contrary or inconsistent terms to these Terms appearing on purchase orders, acknowledgments, or other documents of Purchaser or oral stipulations shall not be binding on HMH.   </li>
<li>BILLING AND PAYMENT.â€ƒAll amounts owing from Purchaser to HMH with respect to any Products purchased from HMH are due within thirty (30) days of the date set forth on HMH's invoice.  Accounts must be current before subsequent shipments will be made.  Purchaser credit limits may be established and modified by HMH in its sole discretion. Past due accounts are subject to a one percent (1%) monthly finance charge. Unless a set-off or deduction is specifically provided for by HMH in a valid credit memo, Purchaser may not charge back to HMH or make any set-offs or deductions, including, but not limited to, set-offs or deductions for violations of customer shipping or routing guidelines and/or other promotional programs.  HMH shall process any credit to Purchaser's account in accordance with HMH's standard practices and procedures.  For any payments made by credit card, Purchaser represents and warrants that it will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless Purchaser maintains all necessary legal authorization to do so.  If HMH does not receive payment from Purchaser's credit card issuer or its agent, Purchaser agrees to pay all amounts due upon demand by HMH or its agents. Unless Purchaser notifies HMH of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on Purchaser's credit card statement or HMH invoice, Purchaser agrees that they will be deemed accepted by Purchaser for all purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable law. </li>
<li>SHIPPING; HANDLING; RISK OF LOSS.â€ƒUnless otherwise expressly indicated on the face of an order, the shipping term for all deliveries is F.O.B. HMH's shipping point (whether to a HMH or third party facility).  Risk of loss and title is passed to Purchaser upon transfer of the Products to the carrier.  Shipping costs quoted are estimates and may vary from the actual costs. The cost of shipping is calculated by taking the Product price and adding 10.5%. Minimum charge $10.00.  HMH will ship Physical Products (defined in section 24 below) using its established methods of packing and transportation, except as otherwise instructed by Purchaser and agreed to by HMH. If Purchaser requires other packing or preparation, Purchaser will pay the additional costs.  In the event that Purchaser requests to pick up its own deliveries of Physical Products by its own carrier, Purchaser must pay 5% of the value of the order as a handling fee.  In addition,  the pickup must occur within 48 hours of  confirming the date and time of pickup or HMH will ship and charge standard shipping and handling rates to a maximum of 10.5%. Customer assumes full liability for the materials upon freight leaving our distribution center dock. </li>
<li>ACCEPTANCE, PRICES, AND TERMS. â€ƒOrders for Products are subject to acceptance and availability.  HMH's list prices and other terms shown are subject to change without notice.</li>
<li>REJECTION. â€ƒPurchaser may, immediately on receipt of any incorrect titles or damaged or defective Products, reject and return them to HMH, with authorization from HMH and at HMH's expense.  Purchaser assumes, and shall bear and pay, all risks and expenses of returning any such Products without HMH's authorization.  Shortages, damaged Products or incorrect titles must be reported within thirty (30) days of receipt of shipment.  In the event of a shortage, HMH shall ship the items or credit Purchaser's account for the shortfall. For damaged Products, HMH shall pick up the Products and issue an appropriate credit or ship replacement Products. For Products showing visible damage on the shipping carton, the carrier must note damages on the freight bill before accepting delivery.  Merchandise damaged in transit must be reported to the carrier immediately.  All original shipping cartons, packing slips, packing materials and damaged Products must be saved until they have been inspected or Purchaser's claim has be resolved.</li>
<li>CUSTOMER RETURNS. â€ƒExcept for Products sold on a non-refundable basis, Purchaser may return, at Purchaser's risk and expense, purchased Products no later than six (6) months (or one month for home schools and individual purchasers) after the invoice date, in accordance with HMH's standard practices and procedures and return policy provided above (including limitations on the period during which Products may be returned) with pre-approval from HMH Customer Service.  Purchaser assumes, and shall bear and pay, all risks and expenses of returning any such Products.  If Purchaser returns any Product that is damaged by Purchaser, used or otherwise ineligible for credit for any reason specified in our policy, HMH has the right to dispose of it without any further obligation, including, without limitation, notice, credit obligation or obligation to return it to the account. </li>
<li>TAXES.â€ƒWhere appropriate, Purchaser shall provide HMH with a duly executed tax certificate indicating that such purchase is for exemption or resale and listing Purchaser's sales tax registration number for each state into which HMH's Products will be delivered.  HMH shall have no liability for any tax required to be billed, collected, and/or remitted by Purchaser as a result of sales of Products made by Purchaser, and Purchaser shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless HMH against all losses, penalties, interest, and expense (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of any claims relating to such liability for taxes.</li>
<li>CHANGES CANCELLATION AND DEFAULT.â€ƒHMH may make changes in quantities, casepacks, specifications, delivery schedules, method of shipment, and packaging, and may cancel or terminate work on any order for its own convenience, in whole or in part, by written or electronic notice at any time.  Any changes to orders requested by Purchaser may be approved or rejected in HMH's sole and absolute discretion.  If the Products purchased from HMH are not as described, Purchaser's sole remedy is to return it in unused condition, complete and undamaged, in the original packaging.  In the event of any default or breach by Purchaser of these Terms, HMH will have available all remedies under applicable law.     </li>
<li>NO RESPONSIBILITY TO SELL MISPRICED MERCHANDISE.â€ƒHMH does its best to describe every product offered as accurately as possible. However, HMH does not warrant that the Products, specifications, pricing, or other content we provide in catalogs or elsewhere is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications of any Products, HMH shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders in its sole discretion.  If HMH charged Purchaser's credit card prior to cancellation, HMH will issue a credit to Purchaser's credit card account in the amount of the charge.</li>
<li>RECALLS.â€ƒIn the event a Product is the subject of a recall by HMH, HMH shall be responsible only for, at HMH's election: (a) supplying Purchaser with corrected versions of the recalled Product(s) in a quantity equal to the quantity recalled; or (b) reimbursing Purchaser for the costs paid by Purchaser to HMH for such Products upon the return thereof.</li>
<li>COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.â€ƒPurchaser shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations applicable to the purchase and use of Products and/or the resale of Products. </li>

<li>SOLVENCY.â€ƒBy ordering and accepting delivery of Products, Purchaser represents to HMH that Purchaser is solvent and will make payment in full when due for such Products in accordance with the applicable invoice.  In the event that the Purchaser orders and/or accepts delivery of any Products while insolvent, Purchaser shall immediately return all such Products to HMH, and any and all Products en route to Purchaser at such time shall be returned immediately upon Purchaser's receipt thereof.  Events which shall be deemed to establish Purchaser's insolvency include, but are not limited to, the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against Purchaser and/or Purchaser's admission of its inability to pay its debts when due.</li>
<li>CLAIMS.â€ƒAll claims relating to any shipment and/or applicable invoice and/or Products must be made in writing within 30 days of the date of the invoice.  Any request for proof of delivery must be made within 30 days of the date of the invoice.</li>
